                            <p> In the spring of 2017, I was finishing my freshman year of college and one of my 
                            advisors mentioned the options I had for my degree to study abroad. I flipped throught 
                            the packet she gave me and saw Barcelona and I instantly knew that's where I wanted to go. 
                            The program would be a year long and I didn't know anyone else who would be going. </p>

                            <h4> The whole summer I thought about what I would be doing and packed and repacked my bags. 
                            To say I was nervous as hell was an understatement. </h4>

                            <p> From the moment I got off the plane and stepped into the beautiful airport, I was hooked. 
                            The taxi ride from the airport to the city was simultaneously the most nervewracking and most 
                            exciting trip of my life. It was the first time I was really doing something on my own. </p>

                            <p> During my year living in Barcelona, I fell in love. The city became my second home. I traveled 
                            around the country and I knew that my next steps would be doing whatever I could to come back after graduation. </p>

                            <h1> <em> And I did. </em> </h1>

                            <p> Moving back to the place I fell in love with was a dream come true. </p>

                            <h4> Now I help other people fall in love with Spain just like I did! </h4>
